\## 🌱 About Me

\- 🎓 Currently a student exploring the intersection of \*\*language\*\* and \*\*code\*\*.

\- 🧠 Fascinated by \*\*Large Language Models\*\*—how they think, how we teach them, and how they can teach us.

\- 🧩 Avid \*\*puzzle-game\*\* player: from Portal 2 community chambers to indie ARGs, if it twists my brain, I’m in.

\- 🛠️ I build small side-projects to \*\*break things on purpose\*\*, then fix them with better prompts, smarter heuristics, or just more coffee.

\### 🔥 Fun Fact

> My first “Hello World” was a brute-force script that solved a Zachtronics game for me—then promptly got me banned from the leaderboard. Worth it.
