 🌱 About Me

 🎓 Currently a student exploring the intersection of  language and code.

 🧠 Fascinated by Large Language Models—how they think, how we teach them, and how they can teach us.

 🧩 Avid puzzle-game player: from Portal 2 community chambers to indie ARGs, if it twists my brain, I’m in.

 🛠️ I build small side-projects to break things on purpose, then fix them with better prompts, smarter heuristics, or just more coffee.

🔥 Fun Fact

> My first “Hello World” was a brute-force script that solved a Zachtronics game for me—then promptly got me banned from the leaderboard. Worth it.
